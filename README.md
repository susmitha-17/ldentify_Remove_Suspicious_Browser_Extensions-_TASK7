# ldentify_Remove_Suspicious_Browser_Extensions_TASK7
Explored browser security by reviewing all installed extensions in Google Chrome.              

**Objective:**
To identify, analyze, and remove suspicious or unnecessary browser extensions that may compromise security or privacy.

**Description:**
In this task, I explored browser security by reviewing all installed extensions in Google Chrome. Each extension was checked for its source, permissions, and purpose. Identified potentially unsafe extensions, such as those marked “Added by a third party”, which are often installed automatically by other software. These extensions were analyzed and removed to prevent data misuse or unauthorized access. The task improved my understanding of browser security risks, permissions, and safe extension management practices.

**Outcome:**
Gained hands-on experience in detecting and removing potentially malicious browser extensions, enhancing browser performance and security awareness.

**Tools Used:**
Google Chrome           
Windows 10
